#  Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog 
## Description 
Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog is more than just a collection of articles; it's a thriving community where individuals with diverse interests in technology come together. My content is carefully curated to cater to both seasoned developers and those looking to dip their toes into the vast realm of tech. With a commitment to clarity and depth, I aim to deliver articles that are not only informative but also enjoyable to read. Dive into my rich repository of tech knowledge with confidence. Model-View-Controller (MVC): Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site, similar to a WordPress platform. Developers can seamlessly publish their blog posts and engage with the community by commenting on other developers' posts. My user-friendly interface ensures a seamless and enjoyable navigation experience. The site follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, utilizing Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
